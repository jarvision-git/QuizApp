# QuizApp

I have developed an Android quiz app using the Kotlin programming language. The app incorporates various features to enhance the user experience.

Upon submitting an answer, the app provides immediate feedback by indicating whether the selected option is correct or incorrect. This real-time feedback helps users gauge their performance and understand their progress throughout the quiz.

To provide a visual representation of the user's progress, the app includes a progress bar. This progress bar offers a quick glimpse of how far the user has progressed within the quiz. It serves as a visual indicator and motivates the user to complete the quiz successfully.

If you are interested in exploring the code for this app, you can find it in the other branch of the project.
